# 💼 TechScrape – Centralized Job Aggregator

**A Python + Selenium-powered job aggregator that scrapes job listings from major tech company career portals and presents them in one place.**

## 🔍 Overview
TechScrape is a web scraping tool designed to collect job postings from top tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. It automates the process of fetching real-time job data and centralizes it for easier access and analysis.

## 🚀 Features
- Scrapes job titles, locations, and direct apply links from multiple company websites  
- Uses Selenium WebDriver for handling dynamic, JavaScript-rendered content  
- Supports easy customization to add more company portals  
- Presents data in a clean, structured format (console, CSV, or future web UI)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Selenium WebDriver**  
- **BeautifulSoup** (optional for static parts)  
- **Pandas** (for tabular data representation)  
- **WebDriverWait** for handling delays and dynamic elements

## 📚 Skills Demonstrated
- Web scraping and browser automation  
- Dynamic content handling with Selenium  
- Real-world application of Python programming  
- Clean and modular code architecture  
- Practical use-case bridging software and job tech

## 💡 Why This Project?
As an Electrical Engineering student passionate about software, I built TechScrape to solve a real problem I faced—visiting multiple job portals manually. This tool automates that task and brings all relevant listings together.

## 📦 Future Improvements
- Build a front-end dashboard using Flask or React  
- Add scheduling and notifications for new job posts  
- Export data to a database (MongoDB or SQLite)
